Hello everyone, my name is Matthew. I'm currently a junior undergraduate studying computer science and astrophysics at the University of California, Berkeley. Welcome to my website, where I will be uploading my research, different projects, cool pictures, and random things of interest. I hope you enjoy!

I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science research. I am currently working on proving complexity results of quantum Hamiltonians. In the past I've worked on combinatorial graph algorithms, distributed protocols, and streaming algorithms.

"We shall not cease from exploration. And the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time."

—T.S. Eliot, from “Little Gidding”, Four Quartets (1943)
