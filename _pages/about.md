Hello everyone, my name is Matthew. I am an incoming Ph.D. student in computer science at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) starting in Fall 2025. Welcome to my website!

I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science and quantum information theory. In the past I've worked on combinatorial graph algorithms, distributed protocols, and streaming algorithms. 

I received my B.A. in computer science and astrophysics at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/). During my undergraduate years, I was fortunate to be advised by [Jason Li](https://q3r.github.io/), [Jelani Nelson](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~minilek/), and [John Preskill](https://www.preskill.caltech.edu/), among many others.
