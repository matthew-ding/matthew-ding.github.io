excerpt: "We devise a deterministic algorithm for minimum Steiner cut, which uses (log n)^{O(1)} maximum flow calls and additional near-linear time. This algorithm improves on Li and Panigrahi’s (FOCS 2020) algorithm, which uses (log n)^{O(1/ε⁴)} maximum flow calls and additional O(m^{1+ε}) time, for ε > 0. Our algorithm thus shows that deterministic minimum Steiner cut can be solved in maximum flow time up to polylogarithmic factors, given any black-box deterministic maximum flow algorithm. Our main technical contribution is a novel deterministic graph decomposition method for terminal vertices that generalizes all existing s-strong partitioning methods, which we believe may have future applications."

We devise a deterministic algorithm for minimum Steiner cut, which uses $$(\log n)^{O(1)}$$ maximum flow calls and additional near-linear time. This algorithm improves on Li and Panigrahi’s (FOCS 2020) algorithm, which uses $$(\log n)^{O(1/\epsilon^4)}$$ maximum flow calls and additional $$O(m^{1+\epsilon})$$ time, for $$\epsilon > 0$$. Our algorithm thus shows that deterministic minimum Steiner cut can be solved in maximum flow time up to polylogarithmic factors, given any black-box deterministic maximum flow algorithm. Our main technical contribution is a novel deterministic graph decomposition method for terminal vertices that generalizes all existing s-strong partitioning methods, which we believe may have future applications.
